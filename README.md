# arduino-controlled-outlet
This project follows the Adafruit ARDX kit and the tutorials in the manual that
is provided with the kit. This project is going to highlight the tutorials that
are directly applicable to creating an Arduino controlled outlet.

#### Project Goals
+ Switch an outlet on and off by reading a light sensor
+ Tune the trigger point for the light with a potentiometer
+ Have an override mode to control the state with push buttons
+ Show the state of the controller with LEDS

## Ardiuno
Arduinos are useful little computers that can that can interact with all sorts of
things in the world. Arduinos can [control cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvpgRNjoAeg).
 They can [control machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ioctbN9JV8) to
 make other neat stuff, like CNC machines or 3D printers. Use them to
 automate your home, [like unlocking doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gzh95w4Hmk).
 Arduinos can also give [life to things and clothes with wearables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALCXWfMRPck).

### Sensing the World with... sensors.
There are plenty of little devices available to allow you to sense just about
anything. Color, frequency, vibration, sound, heat, and [position on the planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lphe8Vih5VY) are just a few examples.
A very simple type of sensor is a variable resistor type.

Variable [resistor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc1wVdbVI0E) type sensors
change their resistance along with the world. For example a [photo resistor
measures the amount of light it is exposed to by changing its resistance along
with the change in light.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9Riurh4y9U).
